## 🚀 **What I Built**

### 🔹 **Recipe Discovery**
Search and explore delicious recipes from **TheMealDB API** and user-submitted content. Discover new recipes to spice up your meals!

### 🔹 **Add Your Own Recipe**
Get creative! Users can submit their own recipes, including title, ingredients, cooking steps, cooking time, category, and images.

### 🔹 **Favorites System ❤️**
Found a recipe you love? Add it to your personal favorites list and manage them effortlessly. You can view and delete your favorite recipes at any time!

### 🔹 **Authentication**
Currently, mock authentication using `localStorage` lets users log in and access their personalized experience. Real authentication (using Firebase or other backend solutions) is planned for the future.

### 🔹 **Interactive UI/UX**
Built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, the app is designed to be clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly. You’ll love the smooth animations and intuitive interface.

### 🔹 **Video Guide Integration 🎥**
Some recipes include instructional videos to guide you through the cooking process. Perfect for visual learners!

### 🔹 **Dynamic Routing**
Enjoy seamless navigation between pages with React Router, creating a smooth, single-page app experience.

### 🔹 **Local Storage Persistence**
User-added recipes and favorite dishes are stored locally, ensuring your data persists even when you refresh or revisit the site.
